# Logics for computer scientists 

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Logics for computer scientists course.

The repository contains a Haskell implementation of a prover for tautologies of first-order logic based on Herbrandâ€™s theorem and the Davis-Putnam SAT solver. The exact description of the task can be found in the [task.pdf](task.pdf) file.
